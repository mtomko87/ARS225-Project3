        <p>
            For this project, I knew that I wanted to utilize my expertize as a computer science student.
            As it turns out, you can make art programmatically right in the web browser, using a canvas.
            A canvas is just an html object that you can draw shapes, lines and curves on, and you can do it all using code.
            For this project I used the user's mouse position and mouse speed to alter what the canvas is displaying, and in this way created several interactive art pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project is a simple example of what kind of art you can make with code.
            In the future I'd like to expand on this idea and see what other complex creations are possible.
        </p>
